Groondlings


Pet and People Projects — Comfort, Craft, and Community

Groondlings began as Pet and People Furniture — modular pet steps, cabinetry, and comfortable seating. As the workshop and skills expanded into upholstery, CNC, laser, and welding, the brand naturally grew into Pet and People Projects.

Today, Groondlings represents comfort-forward builds for both pets and people, ranging from functional furniture to creative small-batch designs.


Mission

To create accessible, durable, and beautiful comfort pieces for pets and people while offering training and pathways in upholstery, CNC, and small-batch manufacturing.
Product Lines
Pet Steps – Modular Baltic birch steps with cork treads, designed for stability, accessibility, and repair.
Column Lamps – Birch and hardwood accents, epoxy-ready, with serviceable lighting cores.
Upholstery – Restored vintage chairs and new builds with resilient foam, webbing, and textiles.
Cabinetry – Practical, modular cabinetry with jig-driven repeatability.


Craft and Capability

Groondlings relies on precision CNC and laser workflows to deliver repeatable, high-quality builds. Deploying a Shapeoko Pro 5 will directly support:
Consistent joinery for cabinetry and pet steps
Rapid development of upholstery fixtures and templates
Efficient lamp and furniture production with reduced waste
By pairing Solyd Solutions’ CAD/CAM files and analytics with Groondlings’ small-batch builds, the Shapeoko Pro 5 becomes central to scaling both product output and community training.
Operations and Impact
Small-Batch Production – Batch sizes tuned to demand, with modular, repairable designs.
Community Training – Documented pathways in upholstery, CNC, and laser for local makers.
Sustainable Practices – Preference for Baltic birch, cork, and domestic or recycled sources whenever possible.
